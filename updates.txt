

Is the entire form custom, or are you inheriting from an existing form? Either way, you want to add a couple fields to the table (in the .py file):

'epf_eligible': fields.boolean("eligible for EPF"),
'epf_number': fields.integer("EPF Number", size=10),

Then you'll need to have the display logic be in the ..._view.xml file, and it will look something like this:

<field name="epf_eligible"/>
<field name="epf_number" attrs="{'invisible':[('epf_eligible','=',False)]}"/>

Now, EPF Number will only show up when eligible for EPF is True.

Graph views

A graph is a new mode of view for all views of type form. If, for example, a sale order line must be visible as list or as graph, define it like this in the action that open this sale order line. Do not set the view mode as "tree,form,graph" or "form,graph" - it must be "graph,tree" to show the graph first or "tree,graph" to show the list first. (This view mode is extra to your "form,tree" view and should have a separate menu item):

<field name="view_type">form</field>
<field name="view_mode">tree,graph</field>

view_type:

tree = (tree with shortcuts at the left), form = (switchable view form/list)

view_mode:

tree,graph : sequences of the views when switching

Then, the user will be able to switch from one view to the other. Unlike forms and trees, OpenERP is not able to automatically create a view on demand for the graph type. So, you must define a view for this graph:

<record model="ir.ui.view" id="view_order_line_graph">
   <field name="name">sale.order.line.graph</field>
   <field name="model">sale.order.line</field>
   <field name="type">graph</field>
   <field name="arch" type="xml">
         <graph string="Sales Order Lines">
              <field name="product_id" group="True"/>
              <field name="price_unit" operator="*"/>
        </graph>
    </field>
</record>

The graph view

A view of type graph is just a list of fields for the graph.
Graph tag

The default type of the graph is a pie chart - to change it to a barchart change <graph string="Sales Order Lines"> to <graph string="Sales Order Lines" type="bar"> You also may change the orientation.

:Example :

<graph string="Sales Order Lines" orientation="horizontal" type="bar">
